- Subtle parallax effects on background elements

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 with semantic markup and accessibility features
- CSS3 using modern styling with custom properties and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript without external frameworks for optimal performance
- Font Awesome for UI icons
- Google Fonts for the Orbitron font family
- Vercel for hosting and deployment

## Responsive Design

The website works on all screen sizes with breakpoints for:
- Desktop: 1200px and above
- Tablet: 768px - 1199px
